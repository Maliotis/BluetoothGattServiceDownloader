{"Service":{"InformativeText":{"Abstract":"This service allows a Client device, typically a sensor, to communicate with a Web Server through a gateway device. The gateway device implements the HTTP Proxy Service and therefore provides the services available through the Internet to the Client sensor device.","Summary":"The HTTP Proxy Service (HPS) allows a device to expose HTTP Web Services to a client. This enables an HPS client device to program a set of characteristics that configures a Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request, initiate this, request, and then read the response."},"Dependencies":{"Dependency":"This service is not dependent upon any other services."},"GATTRequirements":{"Requirement":[{"_subProcedure":"Read Long Characteristic Values","__text":"Mandatory"},{"_subProcedure":"Write Charactristic Values","__text":"Mandatory"},{"_subProcedure":"Write Long Characteristic Values","__text":"Mandatory"},{"_subProcedure":"Notifications","__text":"Mandatory"},{"_subProcedure":"Read Characteristic Descriptors","__text":"Mandatory"},{"_subProcedure":"Write Characteristic Descriptors","__text":"Mandatory"}]},"Transports":{"Classic":"true","LowEnergy":"true","HighSpeed":"true"},"ErrorCodes":{"ErrorCode":[{"_name":"Invalid Request","_code":"0x81","_Description":"A HTTP Control Point request cannot be serviced because content of the URI, the HTTP Headers, or the HTTP Entity Body Characteristic is not correctly, or if the request was made without configuring HTTP Status Code characteristics for notification"},{"_name":"Network Not Available","_code":"0x82","_Description":"Network Connection not available"}]},"Characteristics":{"Characteristic":[{"Requirement":"Mandatory","Properties":{"Read":"Excluded","Write":"Mandatory","WriteWithoutResponse":"Excluded","SignedWrite":"Excluded","ReliableWrite":"Excluded","Notify":"Excluded","Indicate":"Excluded","WritableAuxiliaries":"Excluded","Broadcast":"Excluded"},"_type":"org.bluetooth.characteristic.uri","_name":"URI"},{"Requirement":"Mandatory","Properties":{"Read":"Mandatory","Write":"Mandatory","WriteWithoutResponse":"Excluded","SignedWrite":"Excluded","ReliableWrite":"Excluded","Notify":"Excluded","Indicate":"Excluded","WritableAuxiliaries":"Excluded","Broadcast":"Excluded"},"_type":"org.bluetooth.characteristic.http_headers","_name":"HTTP Headers"},{"Requirement":"Mandatory","Properties":{"Read":"Mandatory","Write":"Mandatory","WriteWithoutResponse":"Excluded","SignedWrite":"Excluded","ReliableWrite":"Excluded","Notify":"Excluded","Indicate":"Excluded","WritableAuxiliaries":"Excluded","Broadcast":"Excluded"},"_type":"org.bluetooth.characteristic.http_entity_body","_name":"HTTP Entity Body"},{"Requirement":"Mandatory","Properties":{"Read":"Excluded","Write":"Mandatory","WriteWithoutResponse":"Excluded","SignedWrite":"Excluded","ReliableWrite":"Excluded","Notify":"Excluded","Indicate":"Excluded","WritableAuxiliaries":"Excluded","Broadcast":"Excluded"},"_type":"org.bluetooth.characteristic.http_control_point","_name":"HTTP Control Point"},{"Requirement":"Mandatory","Properties":{"Read":"Excluded","Write":"Excluded","WriteWithoutResponse":"Excluded","SignedWrite":"Excluded","ReliableWrite":"Excluded","Notify":"Mandatory","Indicate":"Excluded","WritableAuxiliaries":"Excluded","Broadcast":"Excluded"},"_type":"org.bluetooth.characteristic.http_status_code","_name":"HTTP Status Code"},{"Requirement":"Mandatory","Properties":{"Read":"Mandatory","Write":"Excluded","WriteWithoutResponse":"Excluded","SignedWrite":"Excluded","ReliableWrite":"Excluded","Notify":"Excluded","Indicate":"Excluded","WritableAuxiliaries":"Excluded","Broadcast":"Excluded"},"_type":"org.bluetooth.characteristic.https_security","_name":"HTTPS Security"}]},"_xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","_xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation":"http://schemas.bluetooth.org/Documents/service.xsd","_last-modified":"2015-05-18","_name":"HTTP Proxy","_type":"org.bluetooth.service.http_proxy","_uuid":"1823","_approved":"Yes"}}
