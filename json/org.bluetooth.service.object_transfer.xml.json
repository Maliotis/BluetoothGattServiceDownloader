{"Service":{"InformativeText":{"Abstract":"This service provides management and control features supporting bulk data transfers which occur via a separate L2CAP connection oriented channel. The Client is enabled to create and delete objects and to execute an action using the currently selected object. The selected object can be written, updated or read via an Object Transfer Channel opened by the Client. The generation of a checksum covering a part or the whole of the object contents is included as an optional feature. This service provides a general method for a Client to select and initiate the transfer of any type of object.","Summary":"."},"Dependencies":{"Dependency":"This service is not dependent upon any other services."},"GATTRequirements":{"Requirement":[{"_subProcedure":"Write Characteristic Value","__text":"Mandatory"},{"_subProcedure":"Read Characteristic Descriptor","__text":"Mandatory"},{"_subProcedure":"Write Characteristic Descriptor","__text":"Mandatory"},{"_subProcedure":"Indication","__text":"Mandatory"},{"_subProcedure":"Read Long Characteristic Value","__text":"C1"},{"_subProcedure":"Write Long Characteristic Value","__text":"C2"}]},"Note":"C1: Mandatory if the Server supports an Object Name characteristic value that may exceed (ATT_MTU-1) octets in length, where ATT_MTU is the default size for the transport being used;
